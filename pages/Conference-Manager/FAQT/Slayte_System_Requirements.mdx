<ClickableTitle>Slayte System Requirements</ClickableTitle>




For associations looking to run successful and engaging conferences, the Slayte platform offers a comprehensive tool. To ensure the best possible experience, we recommend meeting the following minimum system requirements:


**Web Browser:**  End users should use the latest version, or at least the latest two versions, of their preferred web browser, including Google Chrome (recommended), Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.


**Operating System:** Windows 7 or newer, macOS 10 Big Sur or newer.


**Audio and Video Devices:**  End users should have a microphone and speakers, or preferably a headset, for audio. Additionally, a webcam is required for video if they plan to engage in meetings.


**Internet Connection:**  While Slayte is flexible with internet connection requirements, we recommend a stable connection of at least 1.5Mbps/1.5Mbps (up/down) for general usage. For virtual conferences and media playback, we recommend a minimum of 3.8Mbps/3.0Mbps (up/down) for the best experience.
