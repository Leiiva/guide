This step is Optional. Once you have collected Submissions to your Call, you may want to review them to streamline the process of deciding which to Accept/Reject. The Review Phase covers the period where Reviewers will evaluate Submissions and provide ratings on them.


To eliminate any bottlenecks in the Review process, reviews can be automatically assigned to a team of Reviewers based on assignment rules chosen by you.
