Updates in the system can trigger notifications, to Administrators, Reviewers, and Submitters. Per call, the administrator can configure how frequently these notifications should be delivered.


## **Submitter Communication**


Submitters can be notified about the following events:


* Submission has been received.
* Submission Withdrawn.
* Their submission was rejected or accepted


## **Reviewer Notifications**


Reviewers can be notified about the following events:


* They have been assigned reviewer for a call.
* A submission has been assigned to them (either automatically or manually).


According to both "Submitter and Reviewer Notifications" settings, they can either receive these notifications:


* Instant - Right after the event happened
* Off - No notifications should be delivered


Also, Administrators can enable/disable these notifications at a Call level or per submission/review phase basis when using multiple phases.

2. Click Edit on the right-top corner 


3. Scroll down to **Submission Settings**or **Review Settings**as needed
