The Slayte Conference Manager is available in five tiers. At its simplest, administrators can arrange sessions into a conference calendar. The platform administrators can even publish and distribute a PFD of said calendar. Tier five provides full capabilities for attendees, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors and administrators to patriate in a world-class event with pre-recorded and live session, private and group chats, interactive booths and our proprietary back-stage chat that lets administrators coordinate with presenters around the world.
