<ClickableTitle>Understanding Session Format</ClickableTitle>




The difference between a live and pre-recorded session is that live sessions happen in real time and have a unique, one-time result, while pre-recorded sessions are created with a video before the event is scheduled, and meant to be set on a recurring schedule or made available on demand to reuse more than one time.


Within the session, the event administrator will be able to edit the session in real-time to change live session(s)s to pre-recorded stream(s).Â
