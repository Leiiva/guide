## Step 1: Navigate to “Users”

## Step 4: Provide Group Details


In the prompted dialogue box, provide a meaningful name for your group that reflects its role or purpose. Once you've filled in these details, click on “Create” to finalize the creation of your new group.


 


## Step 5: Add Users to the Group


Finally, it's time to add users to your newly created group. Click on “Add User” to add individual users to the group. If you have a list of multiple users you'd like to add, you can choose the “Import Users from file” option. This feature allows you to upload a file containing the details of the users you'd like to add, which can significantly speed up the process if you're adding many users at once.
