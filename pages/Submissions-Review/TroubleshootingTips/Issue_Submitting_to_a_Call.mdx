<ClickableTitle>Issue Submitting to a Call</ClickableTitle>




As a safe option we recommend first attempting to access the site using **Google Chrome**. In the scenario where you receive an error message when attempting to submit, we recommend following these steps:


1. Ensure you are attempting to submit within any Call **deadlines**
2. Ensure you have **filled all required fields** on the Call Form
3. Ensure all text input Fields take into account any **minimum/maximum restrictions** added for characters/words.


If you continue to face an error message after completing these checks, please send below information to [support@slayte.com](https://docs-for-customers.slayte.com/hc/en-us/articles/support@slayte.com):

* How did you get to the site you see the issue on (could you send us a link)?
* Is there a specific action that causes the error message?
* Could you possibly include a screenshot of this error message?
