## Several Fixes and QoL improvements.


* The SkipLogic workflow has been revised. The form builder now correctly prevents invalid configurations, and as well, indicates through an error message any current invalid configurations.
* Further improved email validations in several areas.
* Several workflows on the submissions module have been improved associated with deadlines, such as:


	+ Linking/Mapping submissions while the phase is not active as the deadline has passed.
	+ Viewing submission and review detail after the phase has lapsed.
	+ Editing Submissions and Reviews if allowed by the administrator on a submission basis.
* An issue in which under “Reviewers” in a call, was deleted, would prevent correct rendering of the page has been corrected.
