Slayte is a [Zoom partner](https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps/iwf4y3oHRIm04kGmx1kWeg) and has the deepest integration with Zoom available on the market. As part of this integration, the software can join designated users as Zoom hosts, without the need for them to be on your Zoom license. This means that you can let your speakers run their own meetings, without the need for a Staff member to join every Zoom session. The speakers can start it themselves.


You can designate on each session which users are the "Virtual Meeting Host(s)" by following the steps below.


Please Note: We do require you to set up the Zoom integration as described [here](https://docs-for-customers.slayte.com/hc/en-us/articles/5098415157139-Zoom-Integration) to complete the below steps (reload the page if the "Virtual Meeting Host(s)" field is not visible after you installed the Zoom app).
