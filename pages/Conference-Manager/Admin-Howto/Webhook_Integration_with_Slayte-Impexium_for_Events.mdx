<ClickableTitle>Webhook Integration with Slayte-Impexium for Events</ClickableTitle>




### Introduction


Impexium can set up a webhook with Slayte to effectively communicate specific actions and behaviors. This is entirely configured within Impexium, and the result is an automated processes within Slayte upon certain actions or triggers in Impexium.


 


### Preparation


Each webhook action requires an API secret, which can be provided by Slayte Technical Support. However, if this is not your first event, you can reference any previous event, and use the same API secret to configure a new event.


 


### Creating Webhooks in Impexium


As an administrator, webhook configurations can be accessed from **Impexium > Apps > Configuration > WebHooks**. Next, click on **Add New WebHook +.**
