## **Calls Module**


**Review focused exports**


Looking to provide the administrators with higher visibility and granularity on reviewers, we now have the ability to run review-focused exports.


* Details such as Submission name, review status, reviewer, assignment, and completion date are included.
* Ability to see reviewer responses on a submission.
* Details on review by Review Phase.
* Export on demands to CSV.


**Multiple Drafts**


Providing flexibility to our submitters, we now have the ability to have multiple concurrent drafts.


* Work on multiple submissions at a time, while being able to return to the existing draft
* Load any stored draft and submit, or discard as needed.


**Reviewer Recusal Audit Trail**


Administrators/Call Chairs now have visibility of reviewers that have recused themselves from a submission, effectively preventing said reviewer from being assigned to the same submission in the future.


* Visibility from the admin side to prevent recused reviewers from receiving an assignment of the submission through multiple review phases.
* Exclusion from a recused reviewer from automatic assignments.
* Reporting on accidental attempts to assign submission for review on a recused reviewer.


## **Competitions Module**


* Administrators are now able to configure ‘'Team instructions’' to present to the participants upon applying on team setups.
* A unique application number is now generated, that is now visible to the applicant and administrator of the competition
* Administrators are now able to configure a custom ‘'Confirmation message’' upon application submission that will be presented to the applicant.


* 


## **Quality of Life Improvements and bug fixes**


* Manual entries on user fields are now validated before submissions.


	+ If the user already exists within Slayte/Impexium database, it is then presented to the user.
	+ Only valid email formats are accepted.
* An issue in which users in chats would not have names have been corrected.
* An issue in which administrators would not be able to close competitions with unbroken ties has been corrected.
* An issue that prevented custom review distribution when assigning submissions to reviewers has been corrected.
* Increased visibility reporting on Conference module remote: export feature for failures.
* An issue that prevented mapping Remote: Export configuration to Impexium: Rooms have been corrected.
* An issue that prevented mapping Remote: Export to Impexium Tracks has been corrected.
* An issue that would cause server fields to de-map themselves has been corrected.
* An issue that limited the visibility of calls presented in ‘'Calls’' view has been corrected.
* Improved performance of the ‘'Reviews Tab’' in submissions when high amount of data is being presented.
* Corrected an issue that would prevent Conference Scheduling ‘'Conflict Detection’' from presenting results when using ‘'Custom Fields’'.
* Improved filters for ‘'Sessions’' tab in the conference module with better usability.
