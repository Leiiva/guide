Oftentimes, to avoid bias, identity or certain information about the submitter should not be revealed to reviewers. You can enable/disable the following criteria on **Call** or **Review Phase** basis: 


* **Blind Review:** reviewers cannot see the author of a submission. Submission authors cannot see their assigned reviewers. Reviewers can see other reviews.
* **Shared Reviews:** Reviewers can/ cannot see each other's reviews. The submitter can view the reviewer's review on their submission as long as the review phase is active.

## **Assigning Fields for Blind Review**


Within the submission form, each field can be designated visibility properties, these include the fields that should be hidden for blind review.


To assign a field, blind review/hidden from reviewer properties, you can follow these steps:


1. From the desired call, under submission phase, select the submission phase in question.![](../../../resources/article-images/115004360428-Review-Privacy-Settings_4.png)
2. Under the Submission Form, click “Edit” or “View Live Form” (and then edit at the bottom).
3. Click the “Hide in blind review” checkbox under the field.![](../../../resources/article-images/115004360428-Review-Privacy-Settings_5.png)
4. Save the configuration settings.


Hide from reviewer has a similar effect to hide from blind review, and the fields will also be hidden permanently from reviewer, without the requirement of the toggle.
