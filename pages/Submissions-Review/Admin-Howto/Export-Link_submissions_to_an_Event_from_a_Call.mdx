3. Search the event to link to by name 


4. From here, you can select the following export/link types:


* Submissions as new sessions: you will be required to select some of the submissions or all that you would like to create a separate session for.
* Submissions as new sub-session on an existing session: you will be required to search by name the existing session to create the sub-session for, to then select the submissions that apply
* A single submission to an existing session: you can only select 1 submission to link to an existing session.

6. Scroll down to **Synchronize data**, and select:


* Link Call and Event: Synchronizes call and event. Any changes on submissions will be reflected on linked sessions.
* Import submission(s) only: Data from the submission will be imported now, but future changes on the submission will not affect the session(s).


7. Click **Link**


Depending on the selected link type, the new sessions or sub-sessions are automatically created in the selected event, and if a mapping was selected; any linked fields are only editable on the linked submission.

If after the export, you no longer want to have the submissions link to the sessions/sub-sessions you can remove the mapping of these fields to be able to edit/manage them directly from the event sessions. You can follow these steps: 


1. From the sessions list, click the **Linked to # Calls** button

3. Unlink by removing the previously selected fields, by clicking the X to the right
