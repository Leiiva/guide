Please note, in order to allow transferring of submissions from one call to another you will need to copy a call then select **Link, not copy, the submission/review forms** (please ensure submission deadline date is current). Another take away from this article is that the submission form from both calls match entirely to transfer submissions./*


Please note, anyone previously assigned or completed reviews will not move with the transferred submission from one call to another. /*/*
