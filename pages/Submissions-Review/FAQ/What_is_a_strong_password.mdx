<ClickableTitle>What is a strong password?</ClickableTitle>




A strong password is one that is designed to be hard for a person or program to guess. Because the purpose of a password is to ensure that only authorized users can access resources, a password that is easy to guess is a cybersecurity risk.


When people create login credentials, they often defeat the purpose by creating a memorable password. They choose their names, phone numbers, birthdays or even the word "password" itself, the most used password for many years.


Now that many password policies require the inclusion of a numeral, the most common password is "password1."


Instead, the best way to prevent a data breach, identify theft or other unauthorized access to private information, is to create complex, long passwords.
