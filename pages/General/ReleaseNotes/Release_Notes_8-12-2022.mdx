## Events Module


* Event attendees can now receive real-time notifications when a new chat message has been received on the platform.


## Submissions Module


* A new submission form field has been added, **Display**. This field allows the administrator to present information to the user in a ***Read Only*** format which can be dynamically updated.


	+ The display field further expands the capabilities and possibilities of the form builder in tandem with skip logic functionality. This allows the ability to evolve a submission dynamically for both the administrator and the end-user to collect data from different stages of the form.

* It is now possible to set a **default value** in fields with multiple values, such as but not limited to Dropdowns, Yes/No, and Single Select.


	+ This new functionality can be used in combination with skip-logic to further expand form-building possibilities.
