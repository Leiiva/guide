2. Under the **Users** section, click the **Profile** tile   
3. Click **Add field** and select the desired field to use


**/*/*NOTE:** The following fields are already part of the default user profile and should not be added to the user profile template: First Name, Last Name, Email, and Profile Image. Also, the order of these fields cannot be rearranged


4. You can decide if the field is required/optional or add a restriction such as Min/ Max # of characters. You can also re-arrange the order of the new fields, or remove them if no longer needed

1. Click **Add Field**, and you can find this field type under the **Additional Elements** section

**Note:**these **Server Fields** cannot be manually edited in Slayte, therefore we recommend you create the users in the AMS before connecting them to Slayte. This ensures that the user's information is properly captured and displayed even if they never log into either platform
