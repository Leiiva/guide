Customizing the view on the table component is a very powerful feature that allows you to change which columns are being displayed, and gives you access to more fields, that you can easily filter/display.


For submissions, customizing the view allows you to add any field in the submission as a column. Assume you're viewing submissions from a call you just created, then customizing the view allows you to add any field from any section as a column, and each row would then display the value of that field in the particular submission.


Please note, it is recommended to have the VIEW button as the last displayed column.


1. Open the desired call


2. Select **SUBMISSIONS** from the menu bar
