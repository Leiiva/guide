You can create and personalize a Call depending on your use case. You can select from a few pre-defined options that will help you to make the call-creating process easier.


1. From the **Home** page, click the **Call tile** or click **Calls** from the left panel.   
2. Long press the **+ Create New Call** button, to display the Call options such as **Custom Call, Committee Selection, and Competition** (US, APAC, Europe, and LATAM), and click to start the creation process.   
/*/*Note: Competition type is available upon request.


The main difference between these call types is in step 3 Template, where depending on the call type; the submission and review phase is automatically set up. 


## **Custom Call**


This call type will not have any submission or review phase included, for you to add from scratch as needed.
