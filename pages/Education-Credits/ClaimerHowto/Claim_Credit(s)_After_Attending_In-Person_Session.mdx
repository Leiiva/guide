6. Click on "Back to Program", to view all your claims and consider submitting to obtain your certificate. Alternatively, you can "Claim another session".


7. Request your certificate & Submit your completed claims and evaluations by clicking on **Submit Claimed Items.**


**/*/* NOTE:** Please do NOT submit your completed set of evaluations (Using the “SUBMIT CLAIMED SESSIONS”  button) until they are all complete so that your continuing education credit documentation includes all applicable credit hours. Once you submit your session evaluations to obtain your documentation (by clicking on the “SUBMIT CLAIMED SESSIONS” button), you cannot add additional session evaluations later for the same program.
