### Revised Category Workflow


The events category workflow has been revised, it is now possible to rename “Categories” and “Values” respectively, as well as to re-arrange.


Additionally, a new feature was implemented with this workflow that now allows the administrator to freely choose any color through a color picker, or HEX/RGB code for each category, this will reflect in all applicable areas.


### Editor Groups


The long-requested feature has finally arrived. Editor groups provide the ability to create event-specific permissions, that allow the Administrator to designate a subset of users to take several actual within the sessions of an event, such as editing Titles, Descriptions, etc.


This feature can be accessed from the “Events” menu under the respective event, followed by clicking under “Events”
