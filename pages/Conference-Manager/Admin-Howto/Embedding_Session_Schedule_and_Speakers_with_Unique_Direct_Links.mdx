<ClickableTitle>Embedding Session Schedule and Speakers with Unique Direct Links</ClickableTitle>




## Introduction


This guide will outline the process in detail for embedding a Session Schedule or Speaker listing for a specific event. This allows individuals to also capture specific sessions of interest or speaker profiles and share links that will link back directly to the content.


When utilizing the embed feature, non-registered attendees will be able to explore the Session Schedule and Speakers without requiring login.


 


## Preparation


### Obtaining the Unique Event ID


When navigating to a specific event, the Event ID is located in the URL while accessing the event:

### Creating Embed Item

To configure the embed, follow these steps:


1. Navigate to **Admin** from the left pane then navigate to the Design section then select **Embedding**


2. Select**ADD EMBEDDED site to** create a new Embedding Site and select Event Schedule (Public Frame)

/*/*Please allow up to 10 minutes for your changes to be applied.


Copy the Embed Code generated below under Embed Code and insert it into your webpage's HTML body. You can create multiple embeddings to accommodate both needs.


 


### Using Embed Widget Direct Links


After using the desired embed type as previously detailed, you can click on any Session or Speaker Profile, and copy the URL path presented at the top, of the specific item you wish to obtain.
