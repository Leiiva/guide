When needed, you can link two or more calls to be able to transfer submissions between them. Please note, the submission form format needs to match exactly on **ALL** calls involved, and the Calls need to be Open/Released to be able to receive those transferred submissions.


1. From the desired call you want to copy and link, go to the **Settings**tab from the top bar


2. Scroll down to the **Copy this call** section, and click **Copy Call**

3. From the pop-up window, assign the new call name and click the **checkbox** for **Link, not copy, the submission/review forms**

4. Click **Create #Copies**


This new Call will inherit all settings and submission/review (if applicable) forms, but no submissions, reviews, Inbox messages, or reviewer's assignments. Click **[here](https://docs-for-customers.slayte.com/hc/en-us/articles/13553075434643-Submissions-Bulk-Actions-)** for more information on how to transfer submissions between calls.
