For your Submissions, you can assign an individual reviewer or a [reviewer group](https://docs-for-customers.slayte.com/hc/en-us/articles/17278292505107) to assist with the review and evaluation process. You can add them either at the moment of creating the Call or once created. 


When creating the Call > Step 2 (Configuration) you can specify for the allocation to be “Manual” or "Automatic" under the Review Settings section:

## **Volunteer reviewer Invitation**


This tool provides an opportunity to invite external individuals to join our platform as volunteer reviewers for your submissions. It's a strategic approach when your existing pool of reviewers is limited or non-existent, opening the door to a broader range of perspectives. Moreover, these volunteer reviewers have the flexibility to specify their availability as per their convenience.


 


To invite, from the Reviewers tab > click the Add Reviewer bottom: 


![mceclip2.png](../../../resources/article-images/4413315125395-Assign-Reviewers_3.png)


In the pop-up window, search or add if not listed internally the desired reviewer. A notification will be sent to the reviewer’s email address for this person to accept our decline to the invitation to be available as s reviewer.
